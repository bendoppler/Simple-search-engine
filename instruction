As we said, we have five types of query.Now, to make it clear , i will present you 5 types through example:

1.$
You must type query in the right syntax .
ex:$500 no spaces between $ and 500

2.#
Like $
ex: #glory
So if you want to combine $ and # or 2$ or 2#. We will use AND/OR query
Example
$500 AND #glory
$500 OR #glory
#glory AND #manutd
$500 OR $200
You must include exactly one space between word and AND/OR. you can replace AND by OR and vice versa.

3.not(-)
Ex: manchester -united. The - must stick with the word that u don't want to appear.
4.AND
Ex: the AND big AND bang. The news must include three words the, big and bang.
5.OR
Ex: Manchester OR manred. The news must include one of two words: Manchester or manred or both.

The interesting thing in here that we can combine all 5 types of query in one search key.For example:
The AND big OR bang AND #manutd -united $500

P/s: if you want to use it easily, please insert your query into query.txt and your answer will ouput to answer.txt
We will output the filename and the row that contain the word key.
